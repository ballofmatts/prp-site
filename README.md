# Party Roll Static Site
[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/ballofmatts/prp-site/tree/master.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/ballofmatts/prp-site/tree/master)  

Source code for a lil site called partyrollpodcast.com.  
Uses Bulma CSS, Angular12, and FontAwesome5.

Uses the podcast's RSS feed to dynamically create episode list/pages without having to rely on any kind of database, meaning this site can be a single page app running somewhere (in this case aws).

If you think there's something wrong or something to add, let me know!

### Development
Clone, run `yarn install`, and then `ng start` to get up and running. Angular should do the rest.
